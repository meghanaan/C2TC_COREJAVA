//Compile time error
//Errors which prevents the code from running because of an incorrect syntax 
//such as a missing semicolon at the end of a statement or a missing brackets, class not found, etc

//Garbage value
//Is a random value at an address in the memory of a computer.
//Whenever a variable is defined without giving any value to it, it contains the leftover from the previous program

//Run time error
//Occurs when a program does not contain any syntax errors 
//but asks the computer to do something that the computer is unable to reliably do
//During the compilation, the compiler has no technique to detect these kinds of errors.
//It is the JVM that detects it while the program is running.
